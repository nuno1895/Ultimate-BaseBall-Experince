# Ultimate BaseBall Experince

Group Project #1 for RCB

## Description
Created a responsive website for baseball fans that incorporates several APIs, that will get you informtion on your favorite team. Once your favorite Team is selected. It will get you the team stats(only for 2016) and all the ticket events coming up. Once you select an event the weather API will either give you the historical weather for that day if it is less the 10 days or if it is within the teh 10 day forecast. We also set up a dummy line up taht will show for that day. Since at the time of creation baseball season was not live we had to use a dummy database for the players. However that part is ready for a paid API to provide that information. Also there is a RSS news tickter by JqueryTicker that we added that will give you the latest news on baseball.
